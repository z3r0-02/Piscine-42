# Piscine-42
Here are my projects done during the first Piscine at 42prague in November 2022.
<br>Some functions were added after Piscine has already ended, while waiting for the results and start of core curriculum.
C7 especially was skipped during Piscine and done afterwards. There can be found multiple ways of doing a certain function in some projects.
I've also added comments inside certain functions to ease the understanding of them.
<br><br> I had no prior coding knowledge, before participating and the first day was hell, but otherwise, it was a very pleasant time.

<br><br><h2> If you're about to participate in Piscine: </h2>

No need to feel stressed, there will always be someone better than you, and most probably some of those already have a coding knowleadge.
What counts, is your own growth and the time you've put in to better yourself.
<br><br>What you should try to do is attend most of the exams and spend time studying in the campus.
<br>Don't be shy to ask for help, from other peers. You will find it very helpful and even get new friends!
<br>Even if you're not done with a project, you can start evaluating and get it explained from others.
<br><br>Just find any possible way to learn!
<br><br>SKIPPING SHELL01 BEFORE EXAM 00 WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA AS EXAMS ONLY CONTAIN C LANGUAGE.

<br> Lastly... do not copy, learn... Even as your last resort, there are other ways to get to the finish line.
Going through shortcuts won't get you anywhere in the long run. But of course, it is okay to study other's codes, as long as you can learn from them.
